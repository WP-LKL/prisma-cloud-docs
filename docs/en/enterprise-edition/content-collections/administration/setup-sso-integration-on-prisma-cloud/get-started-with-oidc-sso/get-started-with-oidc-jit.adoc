== Get Started with OIDC JIT

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to auto-provision users using the Open ID Connect (OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration. This option allows you to manage user identities outside of Prisma Cloud in your organizationâ€™s Identity Provider (IdP). Configure OIDC Just in Time (JIT) provisioning to create new Prisma Cloud users on an as needed basis, when users with the appropriate entitlements log in using OIDC SSO. 

Complete the steps below on the Prisma Cloud console and your IdP to set up OIDC JIT provisioning:

[.procedure]
. Log in to Prisma Cloud using an account with System Administrator privileges to configure SSO.
. Complete the following steps on your Prisma Cloud tenant:
.. Select *Settings > Access Control > SSO* and click *OIDC*.
.. Navigate to *Just in Time (JIT) Provisioning* and select *Enable*.

.. Enter information for the users you would like to provision in the following fields:
... *Scopes* - email, profile, and openid or are always enabled. Specify additional scopes if required.
... *Role Name Claim* - Enter a previously created role. If no role is entered a `group claim` is entered by default. Follow the steps below to configure Group Claims on your IdP:
.... *Microsoft Azure* 
..... On the Azure portal, navigate to *Manage > Token Configuration > Add groups claim > Edit groups claim > Customize token properties by type* and set all token types to use `sAMAccountName`.

... *Default Role* - Authenticated users which do not present a valid Prisma Cloud Role name under the *Role Name Claim* are granted access to this role if specified. 

[NOTE]
====
All authenticated users may have access to the specified Default role. We recommend using a read-only Prisma Cloud Role for this purpose.
