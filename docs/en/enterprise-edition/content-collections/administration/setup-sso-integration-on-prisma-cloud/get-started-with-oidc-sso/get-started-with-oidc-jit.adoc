== Get Started with OIDC JIT

Prisma Cloud offers System Administrators the ability to auto-provision users using the Open ID Connect(OIDC) Single Sign-On (SSO)configuration. This option allows you to manage user identities outside of Prisma Cloud in your organizationâ€™s Identity Provider (IdP). Configure OIDC Just in Time (JIT) provisioning to create new Prisma Cloud users on the fly when users with the appropriate entitlements log in via OIDC SSO. 

Complete the steps below on the Prisma Cloud console and your IdP to set up OIDC JIT provisioning:

.. Enter information for the users you would like to provision in the following fields:
... *Scopes* - Enter the user's email, profile or openid. 
... *Role Name Claim* - Enter a previously created role. If no role is entered a `group claim` is entered by default. Follow the steps below to configure Group Claims in your IdP:
.... *Microsoft Azure*: 
..... On the Azure portal, navigate to *Manage > Token Configuration > Add groups claim > Edit groups claim > Customize token properties by type* and set all token types to use `sAMAccountName`. 
..... On the Azure portal, navigate to *API permissions > Add a permission* and capture all permissions available for Microsoft Graph.
.... *Okta*:
..... On the Okta Admin Console, navigate to *Home > Applications > Sign On (tab) > OpenID Connect ID Token* and select edit. Select *Add groups claim filter*.
..... On the Okta Admin Console, navigate to *Security > API > Authorization Servers > Default* and ensure that groups scope is enabled. 
... *Default Role* - Users not assigned a specific role are granted access to this role once specified. You must specify a default role to enable users to access Prisma Cloud using OIDC SSO.
.. *HOW WILL USERS CONFIRM THIS WORKS?*
